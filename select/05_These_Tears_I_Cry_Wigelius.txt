When you said you needed space,
I never thought that space was litted wrong.
And I thought if I changed my ways
We could get back to what we were before.
I've been twisting and turning in our bed,
And I can't take this sudden change.
Nooo
I'm lost trying to figure it out
Why you nevery naru wore last night.
I thought that we'd be together now and forever.
At least that's what we said.
And i'm still hoping for you to come home.
And though I feel that you're long gone...

Don't say goodbye (say goodbye),
Say you need a little time.
And baby please change your mind (change your mind),
And don't just leave it all behind.
I don't want us to be over,
Let's give it one more try.
And baby please, come back and dry these tears I cry.

Girl, we used to have it made the definition of inseparable.
I you the day all set
We're ama yama last forever more.
Until my love on a bottle our misseries that I thought
That I had left behind.

Now that hole took me for a ride
Baby that's my only crime.
Don't say goodbye (say goodbye),
Say you need a little time.
And baby please change your mind (change your mind),
And don't just leave it all behind.
I don't wanna still be over,

Let's give it one more try.

And baby please, come back and dry these tears I cry.

Oh baby.
Baby dry these tears I cry.
