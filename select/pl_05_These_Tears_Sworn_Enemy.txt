I see the tears run down her
face
Unhappy in her happy place
What it is I think I know
She's trying hard to let him go
She goes
These tears are all I have
Are all I have to remind me
These sweet tears are all I have
Are all I have
Falling gently they begin
soft and salty on her skin
She keeps them coming through
the night
If I could only make it right
But she doesn't want these tears
to stop
She'd rather he was there than
not
And they can be his epitaph
And if she didn't cry, she'd
laugh
These tears are all I have
Are all I have to remind me
These sweet tears are all I have
Are all I have
