These tears are no longer for you, baby
These tears are no longer for you, baby

No more tears shall i weep
Or cry myself to sleep
So long, i'm moving on
These tears are mine to keep
But don't cry

Oh it's so hard
When i think about you baby
Oh I fall apart
When i'm without you baby
But i know I must
Carry on, I won't cry

These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby

I cried away the pain for so long
I sat there and played the fool
Farewell to what was wrong
No more do they belong to you
But don't cry

Oh it's so hard
When I think about you baby
Oh I fall apart
When I'm without you baby
But i know I must
Carry on
I won't cry

These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
These tears are no longer for you baby
