All my gilded dreams
Have torn into streams
Turned my muses in,
Into an awful thing
And oh my god,
These tears could rust a train
And oh my god, these fears
Are a glimpse of the shame
Oh baby, then you go
And do the things you do
In all of your special ways
Yeah all of your special ways
Oh baby, even though
I feel unworthy too,
And it's your special ways,
It's your special ways
And oh my darling,
It's easy falling for your
special ways, for your special
ways
Fade into a field without a map
The cold buzz in my head won't
Turn into the past
And all my movement does the
sadness serve
Useless and awkward as a
flightless bird
Oh baby, when you go
And do the things you do,
In all of your special ways,
I love your special ways
Oh baby, even though
I feel unworthy too,
And it's your special ways,
And it's your special ways
And oh my darling,
It's easy falling for your
special ways,
For your special ways
