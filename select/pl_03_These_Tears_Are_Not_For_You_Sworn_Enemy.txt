I'm not crying cause you're
gone you didn't make me blue
So don't you worry darling
these tears are not for you
I'm not crying cause you've
said you found somebody new
No don't you worry darling
cause these tears are not for
you
I knew all along that you were
only playing a game
Just because I've burned my
wings that's no reason you're
the flame
Don't begin imaginin' you broke
my heart in two
No don't you worry darling
cause these tears are not for
you
[ fiddle ]
Just because you trampled on a
dream that won't come true
Oh don't you worry darling
cause these tears are not for
you
Go ahead and have your fun I
don't care what you do
And don't you worry darling
cause these tears are not for
you
I knew from the start that you
were just a trifling kind
When a new love comes along you
leave a broken heart behind
I'm not crying over all the
dreams you broke in two
So don't you worry darling
cause these tears are not for
you
