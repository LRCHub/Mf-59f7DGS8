I saw you talking to a friend of mine
I asked him what you had to say
You told him that I wasn't doin' to good
I guess, I couldn't argue either way

There's no denying my misery
I couldn't hide it if I wanted to
You want the credit but can't you see
These tears don't fall for you

I got a lot of things that get me down
And I don't waste my time on you
It ain't a tough enough memory
To compare with what I've been through

There's no denyin' my misery
I couldn't hide it if I wanted to
You want the credit but can't you see
These tears don't fall for you

These blues are a long time comin'
Saved up for a rainy day
These tears are not yours fallin'
They're comin' from another place

There's no denyin' my misery
I couldn't hide it if I wanted to
You want the credit but can't you see
These tears don't fall for you

There's no denyin' my misery
I couldn't hide it if I wanted to
You want the credit but can't you see
These tears don't fall for you
