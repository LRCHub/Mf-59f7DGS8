I saw an eagle flying higher and higher, towards the sun
As it passed over me, it turned its head, and seemed to smile
But I could see it had tears in its eyes
Why, father, why?

Hush little children, don't ask such questions, I'm just a man
I worked my fingers to the bone,
To build a world for you, the best I can
I sold my conscience some would say,
Fought and struggled, to see you grow
Don't make me cry an endless river, or tell you where the eagles go
Oh very young one I know,
It hurts you deep inside, the way that things are going
Your day will come for sure, forgive me for the seeds I'm sowing

Take these tears, from my eyes
Let me see the peace, that I have been denied
I was strong, long ago
Now I know that I'll hand over to the young
When tomorrow comes

Sleep little children, don't look in judgment, close your eyes
You're the only ones tonight to see the angels in the skies
So many times I dreamed that I would show you the promised land
Now it hurts me to see the promise scattered like grains of sand
Oh, very young one, be strong,
The burden that I bear is more than I can carry
Your day will come for sure, if paradise is in your heart, take it!

Take these tears, from my eyes
Let me see the peace that I have been denied
I was strong, long ago
Now I know that I'll hand over to the young
When tomorrow comes

Rest easy tonight
For tomorrow the end of the earth
Will be in your tender hands
So realize your dream
And be the best the world has seen
